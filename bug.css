The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of a pseudo-element (:before) is not met due to a specificity conflict:

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div:before {
  content: "Example";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

/* The conflicting style */
div:before {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* Overrides lightcoral*/
}
```

The second `div:before` rule overrides the first due to its position later in the stylesheet. This is a common occurrence and is usually unintentional.

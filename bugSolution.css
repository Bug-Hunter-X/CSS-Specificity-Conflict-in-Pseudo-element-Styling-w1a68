The solution involves understanding CSS Specificity and adjusting the code to fix the issue. There are two main approaches:

**Approach 1: Increase Specificity of the Intended Style**

By adding a more specific selector to the style you want to maintain, you can achieve the intended effect. For example, adding an id to the div would increase the specificity:

```css
#myDiv {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#myDiv:before {
  content: "Example";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: lightcoral; /* This style is now preserved */
}

/* Less specific selector */
div:before {
  background-color: lightgreen; 
}
```

**Approach 2: Reorder Stylesheets**

Ensure the style rule with the desired effect appears later in the CSS file, ensuring higher specificity takes precedence.  This is the simplest approach in this case:

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/* Less specific selector moved to the end*/
div:before {
  background-color: lightgreen; 
}

div:before {
  content: "Example";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: lightcoral; /* This style is now preserved */
}
```
Choosing the best approach depends on the complexity of the stylesheet and the overall design.
